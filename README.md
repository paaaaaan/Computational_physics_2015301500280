An important feature of a linear equation is that the sum of two solutions is also a solution. One consequence of this is that two wavepacketets will travel independently of each other. An especially clear to demonstrate this is to set up a string with an initial profile such that there are two Gaussian wavepackets, located at different places on the string. These wavepackets (or components of them) may then propagate toward each other and collide. Show that the wavepackets are unaffected by these collisions. That is, show that two such wavepackets pass through each other without changing shape or speed.
