Study the shape of the chaotic attractor for different initial conditions. Show that you obtain the same attractor even for different initial conditions,provided that these conditions are not changed by too much. Repeat your calculations for different values for different values of the time step to be sure that it is sufficiently small that it doesn't cause any structure in attractor.
